(4) The default mode of "ofdmda.m" is BER and PER under AWGN environment. Therefore, the fifth number in the simulation result is nothing to mean. If you would like to simulate BER and PER performances under fading environment. You must remove "*" from the top of the following sentences in OFDMda.m.

%[ifade,qfade,ramp,rcos,rsin]=sefade(ich4,qch4,itau,dlvl1,th1,n0,itnd1,now1,length(ich4),tstp,fd,flat);

(5) The above simulation results show that BER=0.5. This means we need compensation of fading. If you would like to simulate the effect of perfect compensation under fading environment. You must remove "*" from the top of the following sentences in OFDMda.m.

%[ifade,qfade,ramp,rcos,rsin]=sefade(ich4,qch4,itau,dlvl1,th1,n0,itnd1,now1,length(ich4),tstp,fd,flat);

%qfade2=1./ramp.*(-rsin(1,:).*ich5+rcos(1,:).*qch5);
%ich5=ifade2;
%qch5=qfade2;

This means that we obtain the information of fading from the fading simulator,
and multiply the complex reciprocal by the received signal.

Then, type the following command again.
